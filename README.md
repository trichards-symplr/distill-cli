# Distill CLI

Distill CLI is a tool for transcribing and summarizing audio files using AWS services. It leverages Amazon Transcribe for speech-to-text conversion and Amazon Bedrock's AI models for summarization.

## Supported AWS Regions

Make sure your default region in your AWS config is on the list of [supported Bedrock regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-regions.html). 

**Note**: If no region is set in your AWS CLI config, the Distill CLI will default to `us-east-1`.

To check your defaults, run:

```bash
aws configure list
```

# Install the Distill CLI

This project is written in Rust, and uses the AWS SDK for Rust to manage credentials and access AWS services, including S3, Transcribe and Bedrock. 

**IMPORTANT**: By using the Distill CLI, you may incur charges to your AWS account. 

## Prerequisites 

Before using the Distill CLI, you'll need: 

- [An AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) configured with an [IAM user that has permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) to Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon S3. 
- [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to access your AWS account.
- An S3 bucket to store audio files, or [create a new one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). 
- [Access to Anthropic's Claude 3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?#/models) via the AWS Bedrock Console.
- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

## Step 1: Clone the repo 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/distill-cli.git && cd distill-cli
```

## Step 2: Build from source

Run the following command to build the Distill CLI from source. This will compile the code and create an optimized binary in `target/release`.

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

You should see a message like this when the build is complete:

```bash
Compiling distill-cli v0.1.0 (/Projects/distill-cli)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 18.07s
```

# Usage

Once installed, it's easy to use the Distill CLI. Each operation starts with:

```bash
./target/release/distill-cli [arguments]
```

Here's a simple example. By default, the Distill CLI will print the summary to terminal unless otherwise specified:

```bash
./target/release/distill-cli -i meeting.m4a
```

You'll see something similar to the following:

```bash
$ ./target/release/distill-cli -i meeting.m4a

Summary:
Here is a summary of the conversation:

The speakers discussed the recent Premier League matches involving Arsenal, Manchester City, and Liverpool. Arsenal beat Luton Town in their match, while Manchester City also won their game 4-1. This leaves Arsenal tied on points with Manchester City, but with a better goal differential, putting them temporarily in first place ahead of City. However, the speakers expect Liverpool, who are currently one or two points behind Arsenal, to regain the lead after their upcoming match against an opponent perceived as weak.

Key action items and follow-ups:

- Monitor Liverpool's next match results, as they are expected to go back into first place in the Premier League standings
- Keep track of the evolving points totals and goal differentials for Arsenal, Manchester City, and Liverpool as the title race continues
...
```

## Application Flow

When you run Distill CLI, it follows this process:

1. **Parse Arguments**: Processes your command-line options
2. **Load Configuration**: Reads settings from `config.toml`
3. **Select S3 Bucket**: Uses the bucket from config or prompts you to choose one
4. **Upload Audio**: Sends your audio file to the selected S3 bucket with server-side encryption (AES-256)
5. **Transcribe Audio**: Uses Amazon Transcribe to convert speech to text
6. **Summarize Text**: Uses Amazon Bedrock to create a concise summary
7. **Save Transcript** (Optional): Saves the full transcript if `--save-transcript` is specified
8. **Process Output**: Delivers the summary in your chosen format
9. **Cleanup**: Optionally deletes the S3 object based on `--delete-s3-object`

# Command Line Options 

| Option | Required | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `-i`, `--input-audio-file` | Yes | Specify the audio file to be summarized. | 
| `-o`, `--output-type` | No | Specify the output format of the summary. Default is `terminal`.<br> **Accepted values**: `terminal`, `text`, `word`, `markdown`, `slack`, `slacksplit`, `teams`, `teamssplit` |
| `-s`, `--summary-file-name` | No | Base name for output files (without extension). Default is `summarized_output`. |
| `-l`, `--language-code` | No | Input language code. Default is `en-US`.<br> **Accepted values**: Check: [Amazon Transcribe Supported Languages Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html) | 
| `-d`, `--delete-s3-object` | No | Whether to delete the S3 object after processing. Default is `Y`. Set to `N` to keep files in S3. |
| `-t`, `--save-transcript` | No | Save the full transcript to a `.trans` file alongside the summary. |
| `-h`, `--help` | No | Provides help for the Distill CLI. |

## Output Types Explained

- **Terminal**: Displays the summary in the console (default)
- **Text**: Writes the summary to a `.txt` file
- **Word**: Creates a Microsoft Word (`.docx`) document with the summary
- **Markdown**: Creates a `.md` file with formatted summary
- **Slack**: Sends the summary to a Slack webhook
- **SlackSplit**: Writes the summary to a `.txt` file AND sends it to Slack
- **Teams**: Sends the summary as an adaptive card to Microsoft Teams
- **TeamsSplit**: Writes the summary to a `.txt` file AND sends it to Teams

### Teams and Slack Integration

For the **Teams** and **TeamsSplit** output types, you will be asked for a short title that will be used when creating the AdaptiveCard. 

To use Microsoft Teams, you will need to create a workflow in Teams that will post to a chat or channel webhook. Copy that webhook into the Teams section of the **config.toml** file.

Similarly, for Slack integration, you'll need to create a [Slack webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and add it to your `config.toml`.

# Config settings

`config.toml` is used to manage config settings for the Distill CLI and must be in the execution directory of `distill-cli`.  

## How to adjust model values

The CLI is intended as a proof-of-concept, and as such is designed to support Anthropic's Claude 3 foundation model. The model, along with values such as max tokens and temperature are specified in [`config.toml`](./config.toml).

```
[model]
model_id = "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
max_tokens = 2000
temperature = 1.0
top_p = 0.999
top_k = 40
```

Note: For newer models, you will need to use a cross-region model_id, for example:

```
model_id = "us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.1
top_p = 0.999
top_k = 40
```

**IMPORTANT**: If changing to a model not provided by Anthropic, code changes may be required to `messages` and `body` in [`summarizer.rs`](./src/summarize.rs), as the structure of the messages passed to Bedrock may change. Anthropic's models, for example, currently use the [Messages API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages.html). 

## Supported Bedrock models

You can view a list of available models at [Amazon Bedrock base model IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html), or via the command line:

```
$ aws bedrock list-foundation-models

{
    "modelSummaries": [
        {
            "modelArn": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/amazon.titan-tg1-large",
            "modelId": "amazon.titan-tg1-large",
            "modelName": "Titan Text Large",
            "providerName": "Amazon",
            "inputModalities": [
                "TEXT"
            ],
            "outputModalities": [
                "TEXT"
            ],
            "responseStreamingSupported": true,
            "customizationsSupported": [],
            "inferenceTypesSupported": [
                "ON_DEMAND"
            ]
        },
        {
            "modelArn": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1::foundation-model/amazon.titan-image-generator-v1:0",
            "modelId": "amazon.titan-image-generator-v1:0",
            "modelName": "Titan Image Generator G1",
            "providerName": "Amazon",
            "inputModalities": [
                "TEXT",
                "IMAGE"
            ],
            "outputModalities": [
                "IMAGE"
            ],
            "customizationsSupported": [
                "FINE_TUNING"
            ],
            "inferenceTypesSupported": [
                "PROVISIONED"
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Additional output settings

### Slack and Teams

To output a summary to a Slack channel, create a [Slack webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks), then update and uncomment the endpoint in your `config.toml`. If you don't set the endpoint, or if the endpoint is commented out, you'll receive the error "Slack webhook endpoint is not configured. Skipping Slack notification.".

```
...
# =============================================================================
# Slack Integration
# =============================================================================

[slack]
# webhook_endpoint = "https://hooks.slack.com/workflows/XYZ/ABC/123"

# =============================================================================
# Teams Integration
# =============================================================================

[teams]
# Hook to primary team channel
# webhook_endpoint = "https://prod-33.westus.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/....."
```

## Automation

Two scripts have been provided that can be found under the **src/scripts** folder.

- distill.sh: Requires the creation of a "in" and "out" folders in the directory where you want to run this cript from. Additionally you must copy the **config.toml** file into the same root directory.
    - This script will iterate through all of the files in the "in" folder and produce a text file of the same name with the summary in the "out" folder. 
    - This script requires you to designate the AWS Account profile by setting it in the **AWS_PROFILE** variable at the top of the script.
- translit-mv: Utility script that will inspect the audio files in the "in" folder and rename them ensuring that transcription and summarization process will not fail to read the files.

## Security

- All data uploaded to S3 is automatically encrypted using AES-256 server-side encryption
- Data in transit is protected using HTTPS connections provided by the AWS SDK
- Webhook URLs for Slack and Teams should be treated as sensitive information and not committed to version control
- For security issue notifications and reporting vulnerabilities, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications)
